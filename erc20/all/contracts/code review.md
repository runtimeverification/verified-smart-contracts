Status: not compatible

Multiple features outside our scope:
  - calls to external contracts

Status: compatible
- 3 failures because contract is not compliant with ERC20.

Extra functionality:
    - burn() - standard functionality. reduces balance and totalSupply.
    - freeze/unfreeze - allows certain balance to be frozen. Straightforward impl.
    - withdrawEther - contract-specific

## 3 Bitfinex
Status: not compatible
- external calls, very complex logic

## 4 ChainLink
Status: compatible
- Slightly extended with an extra check. Otherwise would fit extended template.
- 11 specs out of 12 pass.
- totalSupply fails because is constant, we can adapt that in our template.

Extra functionality:
    - also implements ERC677 - transferAndCall
    - increaseApproval/decreaseApproval - straightforward extensions to approve.

Total: 21

# Variance in mint/burn functionality
Events triggered:
    - Some mint/burn calls trigger only Mint or Burn event, some trigger Transfer, some trigger both.
    - burnFrom is sometimes implemented as burn() with 3 arguments.

Other common functionality in many contracts:
    - Pausable, Ownable.
    - Pausable usually has 2 functions: pause() - pauses transfers. unpause() - resumes transfers.
    - Ownable allows transfer of ownership to another account.
    - Certain operations, like mint/burn are only allowed by the owner.

# Pure contracts, that only contain ERC20 and common extension functions
Order numbers: 04, 05, 09, 14, 21, 23, 31, 33, 34, 44
Total: 10/37 (from all compatible and relaxed template)
