A Proxy contract with a masterCopy of a Standard ERC20 Token has been verified. Both contracts are available in [deployed.sol](./deployed.sol), the spec template is in [spec-tmpl.k](./spec-tmpl.k) and the template params are in [proxied-token-spec.ini](proxied-token-spec.ini).

The token contract diverges slightly from recommended ERC20 practices. E.g. in case of overflow, it returns false instead of reverting. Nevertheless, the contract is ERC20 compliant.
