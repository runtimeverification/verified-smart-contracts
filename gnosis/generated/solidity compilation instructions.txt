Solidity version: v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js
Gnosis version: v0.0.2-alpha

Instructions to produce hex files:

$ cd <gnosis project root>
$ solc --bin-runtime contracts/proxies/Proxy.sol  > gnosis-Proxy-0.0.2.hex
$ solc --bin-runtime contracts/GnosisSafe.sol > gnosis-Master-0.0.2.hex

Resulting files are bigger than .hex files in this repo. They contain the bytecode for multiple solidity classes.
Hex files on this repo were cleared up. They only contain the fragment that was used in gnosis-spec.ini

To generate .evm files:
    Use --asm option instead of --bin-runtime
